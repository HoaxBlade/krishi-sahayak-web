# Production Improvements for Krishi Sahayak

This document summarizes the improvements made to the Krishi Sahayak system to enhance its production performance, reliability, and scalability, along with further recommendations.

## Implemented Changes:

1.  **ML Inference Server (`krishi-model`) - Gunicorn `keep-alive` setting:**
    *   **Change:** Modified `krishi-model/main_production.py` to increase the Gunicorn `keep-alive` timeout from 2 seconds to 5 seconds.
    *   **Benefit:** This change allows client connections to the ML server to remain open for a longer duration, reducing the overhead of establishing new TCP connections for sequential requests from the same client. This can lead to improved perceived performance and reduced latency, especially for clients making multiple rapid requests.
    *   **File Modified:** [`krishi-model/main_production.py`](krishi-model/main_production.py)


## Further Recommendations:

1.  **ML Inference Server (`krishi-model`) - Gunicorn Worker Tuning:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Continuously monitor and tune the `GUNICORN_WORKERS` environment variable based on the number of CPU cores available to the Kubernetes pods and the observed workload. A common starting point for CPU-bound tasks is `(2 * num_cores) + 1`. This ensures optimal utilization of server resources.
    *   **Location:** [`krishi-model/main_production.py`](krishi-model/main_production.py) (comment added)

2.  **ML Inference Server (`krishi-model`) - Asynchronous Gemini API Calls:**
    *   **Recommendation:** If the Gemini analysis becomes a critical, real-time component of the `/analyze_crop` endpoint, consider refactoring the ML server to use an asynchronous web framework (e.g., FastAPI with Uvicorn) or implement background task processing (e.g., using Celery or similar) to avoid blocking the main request thread while waiting for external API responses.
    *   **Location:** [`krishi-model/ml_utils.py`](krishi-model/ml_utils.py) (contains `async get_gemini_crop_analysis`)

3.  **API Route Optimization (`krishi_web/src/app/api/ml/analyze/route.ts`):**
    *   **Recommendation:** Review the Next.js API route that proxies requests to the ML server. Ensure it handles streaming of `multipart/form-data` efficiently and implements robust error handling, including proper timeouts and circuit breakers, to prevent a slow ML server from cascading failures to the web app.

4.  **Caching Strategies:**
    *   **Recommendation:**
        *   **Mobile App:** Explore more aggressive caching for static assets, frequently accessed crop data, and potentially ML model labels if they are fetched dynamically.
        *   **Web App:** Leverage Next.js's data fetching strategies (SSR, SSG, ISR) and client-side caching (e.g., React Query/SWR) for dynamic content to reduce API calls and improve load times.

5.  **Monitoring and Alerting:**
    *   **Recommendation:** Implement comprehensive monitoring for all components (ML server, web app, mobile app) covering:
        *   **Performance:** Latency, throughput, error rates.
        *   **Resource Utilization:** CPU, memory, disk I/O.
        *   **Application-specific metrics:** Number of ML analyses, success/failure rates, image sizes processed.
    *   Set up alerts for critical thresholds to proactively identify and address issues. The `krishi-model` already exposes Prometheus-style metrics, which should be integrated into a monitoring system.

6.  **Offline Capabilities (`krishi_app`):**
    *   **Recommendation:** Thoroughly test and enhance the existing offline ML and data synchronization services (`local_ml_service.dart`, `background_sync_service.dart`) to ensure a seamless user experience even without network connectivity. Document the expected behavior and limitations of offline mode.

These improvements aim to create a more robust, performant, and scalable Krishi Sahayak application.
